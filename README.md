<h2>My New Book Inventory</h2>
<h3>This app was created using Sinatra, Ruby, HTML and CSS. Each file and even the file system was individually created. The content was built from the ground up, from the gemfile to the Rakefile and every MVC component</h3>

<p>The user story for the app is a personal one. I am an avid reader, and an even greater book connoisseur, so naturally I have a deep love of the Bay area bookstores. As much as I love walking out with a fresh stack of books to read, many only make it as far as my "new book table" in my house, which has become a beatiful collection of my new books to be read. Over time, I forget why a book appealed to me or even what it is about. I also lose track of which books I have already own in my library and which have been lent out to friends.</p>

<h3>The finished app is a fully functional inventory system that allows a user to add, edit and delete a new book with relevant details, include an image, a rating (if read), and track the location of the book, whether in the library or on loan to a named individual.</h3>

<h3>Project Milestones</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Converting a rating of 1-5 to actual stars and rendering 'not yet rated' if nil </li>
    <li> Using Bootstrap for the entire project </li>
    <li> Including information about the location of the book </li>
    <li> Using the blockquote to offset the book description </li>
    <li> Sorting the books on the index page by descending order with the .order method vs. .all </li>
    <li> Actually having both edit and delete working at the same time. This proved to be harder than I imagined </li>
    <li> Having a clean design and use of the Bootstrap horizontal form for the first time </li>
  </ul>
